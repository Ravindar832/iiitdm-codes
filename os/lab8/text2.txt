Types of education are commonly divided into formal, non-formal, and informal education.
Formal education takes place in education and training institutions, is usually structured by
curricular aims and objectives, and learning is typically guided by a teacher. In most regions,
formal education is compulsory up to a certain age and commonly divided into educational stages such as kindergarten,
primary school and secondary school. Nonformal education occurs as addition or alternative to formal education.[1]
It may be structured according to educational arrangements, but in a more flexible manner, and usually
takes place in community-based, workplace-based or civil society-based settings. Lastly, informal
education occurs in daily life, in the family, any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, 
feels, or acts may be considered educational, whether unintentional or intentional. In practice there is a
continuum from the highly formalized to the highly informalized, and informal learning can occur in all three settings.
[2] For instance, homeschooling can be classified as nonformal or informal, depending upon the structure.

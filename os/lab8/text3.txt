There are movements for education reforms, such as for improving quality and efficiency of education
towards relevance in students' lives and efficient problem solving in modern or future society at large,
or for evidence-based education methodologies. A right to education has been recognized by some governments 
and the United Nations.[a] Global initiatives aim at achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 4,
which promotes quality education for all.
